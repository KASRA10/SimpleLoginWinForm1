# Windows Form Login Project
A simple Windows Form application built in C# to practice basic login functionality using if conditions. This is a beginner-level training project to explore C# and Windows Forms in .NET Framework.

# About
This project is a basic login form created as a learning exercise. It uses a Windows Form interface where users can input a username and password. The program checks these inputs against hardcoded values using if conditions to simulate a login system. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of C#, Windows Forms, and .NET Framework while creating a functional desktop application.

# What is Windows Forms?
Windows Forms (WinForms) is a graphical user interface (GUI) framework provided by Microsoft as part of the .NET Framework. It allows developers to create desktop applications with windows, buttons, text boxes, and other controls. WinForms is event-driven, meaning it responds to user actions like clicks or key presses, making it great for beginners to build interactive apps.

# [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs)](https://skillicons.dev) What is C#?
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. Itâ€™s widely used for building Windows applications, web apps, games, and more. C# is easy to learn, especially for beginners, and works seamlessly with .NET Framework tools like Windows Forms. In this project, C# handles the logic behind the login form.

# [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=dotnet)](https://skillicons.dev) What is .NET Framework?
.NET Framework is a development platform created by Microsoft. It provides a collection of tools, libraries, and languages (like C#) to build applications for desktop, web, and mobile. In this project, .NET Framework supports the Windows Forms library and helps run the application on Windows machines.

# What is API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary between different systems, enabling them to share data or functionality. For example, an API could be used to fetch user data from a server to enhance this login project.

# What is JSONPlaceholder?
[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) is a free online REST API that provides fake data for testing and prototyping. Itâ€™s a useful resource for developers to simulate real-world API interactions without setting up a backend. You can use it to practice fetching data (e.g., user info) in JSON format, which could be integrated into projects like this one.

# Contributions
Feel free to fork this project, experiment with it, and make it your own! Contributions are welcomeâ€”whether you want to add features, improve the code, or fix bugs. Here are some ideas to get started:

- Add more validation for the username and password.
- Store login credentials in a file instead of hardcoding them.
- Improve the UI with colors or additional controls.
- Add a "Register" feature to create new users.
